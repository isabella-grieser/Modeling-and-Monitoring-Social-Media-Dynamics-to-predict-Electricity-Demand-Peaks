"Modeling and Monitoring Social Media Dynamics to predict short-term Peak Electricity Demand" submitted 
to Progress in Disaster Science. 
It consists of the information diffusion (SIR) and power demand change model as 
well as the SIR parameter estimation algorithm.

This project is made up of two parts:
