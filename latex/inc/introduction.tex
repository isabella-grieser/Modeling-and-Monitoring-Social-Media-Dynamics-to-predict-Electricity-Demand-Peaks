\chapter{Introduction}

This Chapter aims to show the significance of information on social media and 
the subsequent human action based on it
in the context of the power grid infrastructure.
First, in Section \ref{contextmotivation}, the necessary context and 
motivation for this Thesis is provided.
Then, the problem that is considered in this Thesis is described 
in Section \ref{problemstatement}. Afterward, the contribution of this
Thesis is presented in Section \ref{contribution}, 
followed by the outline of this work in Section \ref{outline}.

\section{Context and Motivation}
\label{contextmotivation}

During the COVID-19 pandemic, severe changes in consumer behavior
lead to massive supply issues, thus showing how drastic supply markets 
react to changes in consumer demand.
Consequently, there has been a growing interest in researching 
how shifts in demand manifest during crises. 
One reason for changes in consumer demand is 
social media usage. Through social media, consumers can receive new information
and change their demand on certain goods based on the information received 
through these channels \cite{naeem2021social}.
Current research mostly considers regular, physical 
goods for these demand changes.
However, the results shown in these 
works may not translate well to critical infrastructure,
such as water, energy or communications systems,
with characteristics that differ from physical goods.

The power grid infrastructure is a critical infrastructure 
that is specially important for our society.
Althoug there are no examples of drastic changes in consumer behavior
based on information of social media leading to supply issues or
even the breakdown of the power grid yet, there are still
possible scenarios where the demand for
electricity may increase due to information on social media.
Moreover, the consequences of such events would be critical for the
reliability of the power grid.
For example, a false notice of false notice of reduced prices 
could lead to unexpected demand increase which 
can be even more critical at times of peak demand. 
The additional demand
may increase the total demand to a level that the power grid
cannot support, thus leading to blackouts.
Another example would be that coordinated actions to reduce
power, either in regards to combat climate change \cite{earthday}
or as an attack against the state by conspiracy theorists,
lead to a sudden, non-negligible mismatch of supply and demand.


\section{Problem Statement}
\label{problemstatement}

To reduce the probability of blackouts, 
the resilience of the power grid is of vital importance.
To assure the resilience of the power grid, a variety of possible 
scenarios which could negatively affect the power grid need
to be analyzed. Moreover, countermeasures need to be made for all possible scenarios.
Thus, it is reasonable to analyze theoretical scenarios that, even though
they never happened until the present time, could plausibly happen. This 
would allow policymakers to draw countermeasures to these possible scenarios
and allow for quick and decisive actions to be taken by relevant 
parties.

Until now, there are already works which analyze the possible effects
of information, specially misinformation, on the power
grid. But these works were of theoretical nature and did not 
propose any kind of detection system to warn of a possible 
for the power grid. Furthermore, these works did only analyze the 
possibility of a false notice of reduced electricity prices.
No other scenarios are analyzed in these works. 


\section{Contribution}
\label{contribution}
This thesis makes a dual contribution to addressing the issue of 
power demand fluctuations via social media.
First, this Thesis analyzes multiple different scenarios, in which
information on social media leads to a change in power demand.
Second, this Thesis proposes a framework to predict if 
a certain topic on social media is propagating through social media
in a speed that could lead to issues for the power grid.

\section{Outline}
\label{outline}

First, the necessary background for this Thesis is explained
in Chapter \ref{background}. 
In Chapter \ref{relatedworks}, works related to 
this Thesis are introduced.

Next, in Chapter \ref{implementationall}, the framework to
analyze and predict possible power demand surges based on
information on social media is introduced. Furthermore,
an algorithm to estimate parameters to realistically simulate
the effects of information on social media is introduced and 
the all steps of the framework are explained.

Then, in Chapter \ref{results}, the different scenarios considered in this
Thesis are analyzed. ..... (TODO)
