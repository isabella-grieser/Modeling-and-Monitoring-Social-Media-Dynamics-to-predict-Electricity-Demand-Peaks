\chapter{Implementation of a Framework to model the Effect
of Information on Social Media on the Power Grid}

In this chapter, a framework to analyse the effects of information on the 
power grid will be introduced and the specific implementation of the 
framework will be explained.
First, in Section \ref{simulationframeworksection}, 
the implementation of the simulation framework will described.
For this, the model for the social media network structure,
will be introduced in Section \ref{socialmediaimplementation}.
Then the information diffusion model, used to model the information 
propagation process in the system, will be explained in Section 
\ref{infodiffusionimplementation}. Afterwards, the method to 
model the excess power consumption will be introduced in Section 
\ref{powerconsumptionimplementation}. 

\section{Implementation of the Simulation Framework}
\label{simulationframeworksection}
There are multiple components that are essential to model the effects of 
both true and false information on critical infrastructures
such as the power grid. First, it is necessary to model an 
exemplary
