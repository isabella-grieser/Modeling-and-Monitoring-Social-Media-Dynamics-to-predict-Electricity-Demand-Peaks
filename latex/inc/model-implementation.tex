\chapter{Implementation of a Framework to model the Effect
of Information on Social Media on the Power Grid}

In this chapter, a framework to analyse the effects of information on the 
power grid will be introduced and the specific implementation of the 
framework will be explained.
First, in section \ref{simulationframeworksection}, 
the implementation of the simulation framework will described.


\section{Implementation of the Simulation Framework}
\label{simulationframeworksection}
There are multiple components that are essential to model the effects of 
both true and false information on critical infrastructures
such as the power grid. The development of the simulation framework
proposed in this work can be divided into three parts. First, it is necessary to model an 
example social media network graph with characteristics similar to
real social media networks. Second, an algorithm to model the 
propagation of information over the network needs to be defined and 
implemented. Third, rules to estimate the changes in the power consumption 
need to be defined and a general simulation algorithm needs to be implemented.
